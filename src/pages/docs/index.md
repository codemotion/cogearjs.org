# About

**Cogear.JS** is a static websites generator built with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) and based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) (v4.6).

It's inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and others, but built on the top of the latest frontend technologies.

Provides awesome experience of on-the-fly hot reloading to instantly implementing any changes.

## Features
* It can be usefull to build modern static websites (using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Ember](https://emberjs.org)) or even for rapid prototyping.
* It's **blazing fast and reliable** being online. Server can handle thousands requests per seconds to serve static files (even on tiny VPS).
* It doesn't requires **any database** and works on **any hosting** (as it produces *static html and assets files*).
* It's **100% secure** for hacking because there is no backend after being deployed to the server.
* It can use **any modern frontend stack** because it has **Webpack** in it's core.

Using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (or any similar project) you can host generated site **for free**.

### What it can be used for:
* Rapid site prototyping 
* Portfolio site
* Company site
* Product site
* Personal blog
* Artist or musician site

Any site that has admin-generated content.

Using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) or any other _backend_, written in _any lang_ (**PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **Node.JS**) or even with CMS like a **WordPress**, with help of modern frontend technologies like [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org), it can be turned into more dynamic site like **e-commerce**, **products catalog** and so on.

### What it cannot be used for:
* Forum
* Social network
* Chat

Or any other site type with great amount of user-generated content which relies on heavily database usage and dynamically generated pages.

Of course, you can try, but it has to be modern [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) which handles data from API.


# Requirements

You have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) (9.x or higher) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (usually comes together) to be installed.

[Download and install.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

The latest version (v10.9.0) is recommended.

You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) instead of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com).

**Cogear.JS** runs on:
* Mac
* Linux
* Windows

You may want to use awesome [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.

# Installation
To install **Cogear.JS** do next:
```bash
> npm install cogear -g
# or
> yarn global add cogear
```
Done. Congratulations!

**Cogear.JS** is now available via cli-command `cogear`.

Now you're ready to build your first site.

# Usage
Go to the directory where all your local sites are hosted.
```bash
> cd ~/Sites
```
Create a new site via command:
```bash
> cogear new site.io # where "site" is your site folder name

# if you have a preset, use it's git repo address as fourth arg
> cogear new site.io https://github.com/codemotion/cogear-preset-docs
```

> Preset is a github repo which is being cloned locally. It's just an analog of `git clone` command.

After that go to site dir:
```bash
cd ~/Sites/site.io
```

And start up **Cogear.JS** in `development` or `production` mode ([learn more](/docs/workflow#modes)).
```bash
> cogear # run in develompent mode with hot-reload â€“ by default

> cogear production # build a site and run local server
```

# Options
All available options can be seen via `--help` (or shortcut `-h`) command.
```bash
> cogear -h

Runs in development mode by default (without [command]).

Options:

  -h, --help          output usage information
  -s, --src           set source directory, default: ./src
  -o, --output        set output directory, default: ./public
  -h, --host          set host for local server, default: localhost
  -p, --port          set port for local server, default: 9000
  -o, --open          if set to false, browser will not be opened after build, default: false
  -v, --version       print current version
  -w, --verbose       set webpack verbose mode, default: true

Commands:

  command   (alias)     [optional]      description

  [dev]        (dev)                   run dev server # hot-reload for pages, scripts, styles [DEFAULT]
  production   (prod)                  run build and starts static server # optional, default, no hot reload on changes
  build        (b)                     run build
  deploy       (d)       [preset]      deploy site to server
