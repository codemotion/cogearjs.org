# Getting started
# About

**Cogear.JS** is a static websites generator built with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) (9.x or higher) and based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) (v4.6).

It's inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and others, but built on the top of the latest frontend technologies.

Provides awesome hot reloading experience in `development` mode.

## Features
* ðŸ–¥  **Modern stack of technologies** <br>Build modern static websites with bundled scripts and styles.<br>Rapidly prototype and instantly deploy to the server.<br>
Use **any modern frontend stack** (**webpack** bundled) â€“ [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Ember](https://emberjs.org), etc.
* ðŸš€  **Blazing fast and reliable**<br>
Performs nearly 1.000 pages per second (depends on the pages content and raw computer processor power).<br>
 Server can handle thousands requests per second to serve static files (even on tiny VPS).
* ðŸ“¦ **For any hosting**<br>
Doesn't require **any database** (data stored in flat files) and works with **any hosting** (as it produces *static html and assets files*).
* ðŸšš  **Deploy built in**<br>
[Create a preset](/docs/deploy) and update your site to the server via FTP, SFTP or even `rsync`.
* ðŸ”“ **Secure. No updates needed**<br> 
Just forget about annoying regular updates from usual CMS.<br>
It's **100% secure** for hacking because there is no backend after being deployed to the server.
* <i class="fab fa-osi" style="color: green"></i> **Free. Open Sourced**<br>
Use it for free. For any needs. Forever.<br>

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (or any similar project) you can host generated site **for free**.

### What it can be used for:
* Rapid site prototyping 
* Portfolio site
* Company site
* Product site
* Personal blog
* Artist or musician site

Any site that has admin-generated content. 

> Multi-user content management can be provided via [Github](https://github.com). Just store your source in the repository, accept pull-requests from other users and build a site after commits (can be automated).

Using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) or any other _backend_, written in _any lang_ (**PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **Node.JS**) or even with CMS like a **WordPress**, with help of modern frontend technologies like [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org), it can be turned into more dynamic site like **e-commerce**, **products catalog** and so on.

### What it cannot be used for:
* Forum
* Social network
* Chat

Or any other site type with great amount of user-generated content which relies on heavily database usage and dynamically generated pages.

Of course you can try, but it has to be modern [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) which handles data from dedicated API.


# Requirements

You have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) (9.x or higher) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (usually comes together) to be installed.

[Download and install.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

The latest version (v10.9.0) is recommended.

You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) instead of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com).

**Cogear.JS** runs on:
* Mac
* Linux
* Windows

You may want to use awesome [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.

# Installation
To install **Cogear.JS** do next:
```bash
$ npm install cogear -g
# or
$ yarn global add cogear
```
Done. Congratulations!

**Cogear.JS** is now available via cli-command `cogear`.

Now you're ready to build your first site.

# Usage
Go to the directory where all your local sites are hosted.
```bash
$ cd ~/Sites
```
Create a new site via command:
```bash
$ cogear new site.io # where "site" is your site folder name
```

After that go to site directory:
```bash
$ cd ~/Sites/site.io
```

And start up **Cogear.JS** in `development` or `production` mode ([learn more](/docs/workflow#modes)).
```bash
$ cogear # run in develompent mode with hot-reload â€“ by default

$ cogear production # build a site and run local server
```

# Options
All available options can be seen via `--help` (or shortcut `-h`) command.
