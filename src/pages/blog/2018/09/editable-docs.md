Good news! Now everyone, who wanna edit the docs, can do it via push request to the Github repository (take a look at pencil icon on the image below). 

Yes, we've moved this site to Github and now anyone can look through the code to find out what's going on here.

Please, take a look:

If you have suggestions for improving the site or you want to participate in **Cogear.JS** development - you're welcome.
