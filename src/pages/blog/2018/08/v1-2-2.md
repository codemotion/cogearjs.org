Let's take a look at v1.2.2  which makes **Cogear.JS** a little bit better.

## Commander.JS

Now all command-line commands are served by [`commander`](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/).

```javascript
commander
	.command('build')
	.alias('b')
	.description('Build mode: just build.')
	.action(async()=>{
		cogear.mode = "build"
		await cogear.emit('init')
		cogear.options.open = false
		cogear.on('webpack.afterEmit',async(compilation)=>{
			await cogear.emit('build',compilation)
		})
		await cogear.emit('webpack',{
			mode: 'production',
		})
	})
```

## WebpackBar
Look at terminal above (at the post top). Now webpack-compilation process if more obvios.

We've implemented [`wepbackbar`](https://github.com/nuxt/webpackbar).

## HardSourceWebpackPlugin
Of course [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is a bottleneck of build performace. No matter how many pages do you have, but if your webpack-compiled assets are huge (with dependencies), total build time may by slowed down. But now, with the help of [Hard Source Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/mzgoddard/hard-source-webpack-plugin) compilation time is drastically decreased. It's almost the best caching tool for `Webpack`.

Results for this site webpack compilation time:

Before|After (slowest)|After (fastest)
:----:| :---: |:-----:
20s|6s|1s

The first compilation may take a while, but all others are blazing fast ðŸš€.

## Any ideas?

If you have any ideas, you may fork [project repository](https://github.com/codemotion/cogear.js) and make a `push commit` for us to implement them into the newer version of **Cogear.JS**.

We also will be glad for your comments.
