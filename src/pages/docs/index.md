# About
**Cogear.JS** is a static site generator build with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) and based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) (v4.6).

It's inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and others, but built on the top of the latest frontend technologies.

Providing awesome experience of on-the-fly hot reloading to instantly implementing any changes.

## Features
* It can be usefull for building modern static websites (using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https:/angular.io), [Ember](https://emberjs.org)) or even for rapid prototyping.
* It's **blazing fast and reliable** being online. Server can handle thousands requests per seconds to serve static files (even on tiny VPS).
* It doesn't requires **any database** and works on **every hosting** (as it produces *static html and assets files*).
* It's **100% secure** for hacking because it has no backend after being deployed to the server.
* It can use **any modern frontend stack** because it uses **Webpack** in system core.

Using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (or any similar project) you can host generated site **for free**.

### What it can be used for:
* Rapid site prototyping, 
* Portfolio site,
* Company site,
* Product site,
* Personal blog,
* Artist or musician site.

Any site that has its administrator generated content.

Using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) or any other _backend_, written in _any lang_ (**PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **Node.JS**) or even with CMS like a **WordPress**, with the help of modern frontend technologies like [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org), it can be turned into more dynamic site like **e-commerce**, **products catalog** and so on.

### What it cannot be used for:
* Forum,
* Social network,
* Chat.

Or any other site type with great amount of user-generated content which relies on heavily database usage and dynamically generated pages.
