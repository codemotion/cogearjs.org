As you can see it's even suitable for blogging! Every blog post can have comments via modern services like [Disqus](https://disqus.com). Posts can also be tagged.

All blog pages are built automatically and rebuilt when proper content pages are changed, added or deleted.

> Posts can even have teaser which is splitted from main content by 3 and more `=`,`:`,`_`,`--` symbol (new line only).

To create a blog on your site, please install [`cogear-plugin-blog`](https://github.com/codemotion/cogear-plugin-blog) npm package and follow the instructions in `README.md` file.
